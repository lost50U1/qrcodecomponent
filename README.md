### What I learned

I learned more about websites layout.

I used this media query to make it responsive for desktop screen:

```css
/* for desktop size 1440px */
@media only screen and (min-width: 1440px) {
    main{
    margin-top: 20vh;
    }
}   
```

### Useful resources

- [Card component on freecode camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-basics-by-building-a-card-component/) - This helped me cause it got similar layout to some level.
